# macDriveEjector
The macDriveEjector is a program targeted at individuals using Windows 10 & 11 on a Macintosh computer with an **internal** optical disc drive.

All Macintosh computers with ODDs are designed to not have a physical eject button, and the eject button is placed on the keyboard instead. macOS is designed to register inputs from this specialized key, but
Windows is not. This program adds a unique hotkey for ejecting disc drives when using Windows on an Intel Mac, and even supports dual disc drives for Mac Pro users.
